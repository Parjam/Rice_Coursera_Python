Rice_Coursera_Python
====================

These are my answers to the mini projects of "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" course by Coursera and Rice University.

If you want to try these games, you have to go to "http://www.codeskulptor.org" and copy/paste the code. To run the code, you need access to built-in libraries that are available in this environment.

Happy Playing ...
